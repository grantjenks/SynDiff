SynDiff

This file details how to add language support for another language in Syndiff.

Files needed:

your_grammar_file.jj

Please see the JTB and JavaCC documentation on the format and restrictions for
the grammar file.

Files to change:

Build files:
build\cleanall.bat
build\langbuild.bat

Change cleanall.bat to delete the language files which will be generated at:
src\syndiff\lang\your_grammar_name

Change langbuild.bat to generate and add the language files. Please refer to
the comments in that file for information on how this should be structured.

Source files:
src\syndiff\utils\Statics.java
src\syndiff\utils\TreeBuildHandler.java

Change Statics.java to include the new language in processing command line
arguments and dispalying usage. Also change the enumerated language type
to include the name of your language.

Change TreeBuildHandler.java to include parsing and setting the global tree
root node variables. Please refer to the comments in this file for details
on the structure of this change.

Performing the above changes will work in the general case of adding language
support. If your grammar or language has specific edge cases then you may need
to modify this process as needed.
